This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable borrowing.  The code attempts to create two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable `x` simultaneously.  Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents this to avoid data races and other concurrency issues. The solution demonstrates how to fix the issue using techniques like cloning or altering the program's logic.
